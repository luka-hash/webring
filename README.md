# webring

Simple webring for humans <3

## Usage

Build it with `go build`. You also need a few more files:

- index file = a golang template containing the page for the root of the webring
- members file = csv with (name, url) pair
- some icons and other visuals = icons, badges, etc

Take a look at the `example` directory.

The server uses port `8080`.

## Is it any good?
