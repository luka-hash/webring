Welcome to _Webring._

This webring has the goal of sharing traffic between its members and growing
the surrounding network. We welcome websites, wikis, portfolios, and similar
spaces created by humans and intended for human consumption. 

We are very welcoming, but we do draw a line at some things:
- Hate speech of any kind, including but not limited to sexism, homophobia,
  racism, ableism, antisemitism, etc.
- Harassment, doxxing, trolling, scamming, spamming, or other similar kinds of
  behaviour.
- Advertisement-focused sites are not welcome.
In the absence of explicit instructions, we expect all members to uphold
conventional norms of appropriate behavior and communication. Thanks :)

Rules for joining:
1. Create a website and add content to it.
2. Add the webring links to your website (we leave it up to you to choose
where).
3. Send en email to the webring admin, and introduce yourself :)

In you have any questions about the guidelines, rules or anything else, or you
want to report abuse, do not hesitate and contact the admin.

If you want to host your own webring - use github.com/luka-hash/webring . <3

Enjoy!
